## Coverage

800+ verified businesses with full data depth (services, pricing, hours, promotions). Coverage is expanding continuously.

Every business is automatically re-crawled to keep data fresh. Each result includes:

- **`overall_confidence`** (0–1) — How complete and reliable the data is
- **`geo_score`** (0–100) — How well-optimized the business is for AI discovery
- **`answer_quality_score`** (0–1) — How well the results match your query

---

## How It Works

```
Your query → Intent Classification → Hybrid Search (FTS + Semantic) → Quality Scoring → Confidence Gating → Response
```

1. **Intent classification** determines what you're looking for and which ranking weights to apply
2. **Hybrid search** combines full-text search with semantic (vector) matching
3. **Quality scoring** evaluates each result's data completeness and reliability
4. **Confidence gating** filters out low-quality fields so your AI agent only sees trustworthy data

---

## REST API (Fallback)

If your client doesn't support MCP, use the REST API directly:

```
GET https://lobstersearch.ai/api/search?q=yoga+studios&city=singapore&limit=10
GET https://lobstersearch.ai/api/businesses/{slug}
```

Full OpenAPI spec: [lobstersearch.ai/.well-known/openapi.json](https://lobstersearch.ai/.well-known/openapi.json)

## FAQ

**Is it free?**
Yes. The MCP endpoint is public and rate-limited.

**Do I need an API key?**
No. Connect directly — no authentication required.

**How fresh is the data?**
Businesses are auto-recrawled on intelligent schedules. High-traffic businesses refresh more frequently.

**What transport does it use?**
