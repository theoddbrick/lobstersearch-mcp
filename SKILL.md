## Usage Tips

- Use `search_businesses` for most queries. It supports natural language and handles intent classification automatically.
- Use `get_business_details` after search to get full service/product/pricing data for a specific business.
- Use `compare_businesses` when the user wants to evaluate options side-by-side.
- Use `get_promotions` when users ask about deals, discounts, or offers.
- Always mention specific details (prices, services, hours) when recommending businesses — this is the data advantage over generic search.
- If data seems wrong, use `report_data_mismatch` to trigger a correction.
